# Project Summary: CoverCraft

## Project Goals
The goal of the CoverCraft project is to develop a user-friendly mobile app that allows users to easily create custom-fit covers for various objects using readily available materials like tarps. The app will generate sewing patterns based on user-provided photos and specifications, enabling users to create protective covers for items such as UTVs, PWCs, wheelbarrows, and more.

## Requirements
1. User-friendly interface for taking or uploading photos of objects from front and side angles
2. Ability to calibrate object size by selecting two points on the photos
3. Option to choose the resolution of the cover (low, medium, high)
4. Accurate 3D modeling of the cover based on object dimensions and selected resolution
5. Automatic unfolding of the 3D model into a 2D sewing pattern
6. Generation of a transparent GIF output with the sewing pattern and a legend indicating scale
7. Optimization for performance and user experience
8. Cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android)

## Features
1. Simple and intuitive user interface
2. Customizable cover resolution (low: 5 sides, medium: 6-10 panels, high: up to 15 panels)
3. Accurate scaling of the sewing pattern based on user-defined measurements
4. Single-page transparent GIF output for easy projection and cutting
5. Compatibility with a wide range of object sizes and shapes
6. Fast and efficient processing of user input and pattern generation
7. Ability to save and share generated patterns
8. Comprehensive help and tutorial section

## Future Enhancements
1. Support for adding openings, windows, vents, zippers, or velcro to the pattern
2. Integration with a marketplace for purchasing materials and accessories
3. Community features for sharing and discovering user-created patterns
4. Advanced editing tools for refining generated patterns
5. Compatibility with additional file formats for pattern output
