    Dependency Check Suppressions for CoverCraft
    
    This file is used to suppress false positive vulnerability reports.
    Each suppression should include:
    - Clear reasoning for why it's a false positive
    - CVE number being suppressed
    - Affected file pattern
    - Expiration date for periodic review
  -->
  
  <!-- Example suppression (currently no suppressions needed):
  <suppress>
    <notes>
      False positive: This vulnerability affects server-side usage only,
      but we only use this library client-side in iOS app context.
    </notes>
    <cve>CVE-2021-12345</cve>
    <filePath regex="true">.*example-library.*</filePath>
    <until>2025-12-31</until>
  </suppress>
  -->
  
  <!-- Apple Framework False Positives -->
  <!-- 
    Note: Dependency Check may flag Apple system frameworks as vulnerabilities.
    These should be suppressed as they are part of iOS and managed by Apple's security updates.
    Add suppressions here if false positives occur for ARKit, SceneKit, SwiftUI, etc.
